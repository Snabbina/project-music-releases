# Music Releases

This project was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases by extracting spotify API data.
Focus was to learn how to write React components, use .map to iterate over arrays and use props to to feed information to components.
this was done as a par-programming project.

## The problem

We struggled quite a bit with getting album cover img to show on the website and how we were gonna structure the code.
It took a lot of trial and error to make it work.
